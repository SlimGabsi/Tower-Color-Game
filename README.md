## Additional Features
* The objcetive of this game is collapsing the tower wich bring to the player a feeling of satisfactin and reward. Thus I thought about boosting those asthethics by adding a new type of projectile, the Super Ball (Multicolor ball) wich explode on any target color and provide a stunnig explosion effect.
* I found that the original game has no audible feedback, so I thought about adding sound effects. That's why i added 4 Sound Effects : 
  1. Throwing Ball Sound Effect
  2. Tower Collision Sound Effect
  3. Ball Explosion Sound Effect
  4. Super Ball Explosion Sound Effect
