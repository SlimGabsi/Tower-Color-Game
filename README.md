# Tower Color Game
**Tower Color** is a Unity Project built in a mobile plateform (Android) that allows the user to play a casual game. The concept of the game is to drop the Tower with projectiles by throwing them on the the same color elements.

## Features
* Camera Animation.
* Projectile throwing.
* Destruction of the Touched Object and same color contouring Objects.
* Particle System Instantiation at destruction moment.
* Lock and Unlock the tower elements.
* Intuitive UX design.
* Funny color choice (Cartoon style)

## Additional Features
* The positive point of this game is the satisfaction that the user feels when a block of tower elements fall together, so I thought to highlight this feeling by adding an explosion effect. That's why I created the super ball (multicolor ball) that ensures this effect.
* I found that the original game is dry, so I thought about adding sound effects. That's why i added 4 Sound Effects : 
  1. Throwing Ball Sound Effect
  2. Tower Collision Sound Effect
  3. Ball Explosion Sound Effect
  4. Super Ball Explosion Sound Effect

## Installation
1. Copy the "TowerColor.apk" found under the "App" folder and Paste it in your Android mobile.
2. Click on the apk file and follow the installation process.
